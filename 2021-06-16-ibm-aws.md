We’ve recently had a lot of feedback and questions from the Travis CI community about open source at Travis CI, and we wanted to share a quick update to clear up any confusion. 

Open source will always be core to Travis CI – this is reflected in our partnerships with leaders in the open source world (like ARM, AWS, and IBM) to give open source projects the power to build, test and deliver the software that powers the internet and beyond. Over 300,000 projects trust the speed and reliability of Travis CI, including Apache HTTP Server, Ruby, and Geany.

We recently provided revised terms of service directly to open source customers via email, which caused some confusion. Our intent was to ensure the infrastructure we have designated for open source projects is used exclusively by projects that align with the goals of the open source community versus projects for expressly commercial purposes. We understand that other organizations contribute to the open source community through donating things like developer time, and these contributions will in no way limit open source projects from building on Travis CI for free.

This past month Travis CI enabled a Zero-Credit Partner Queue Solution whereby developers building for open source repositories on sponsored infrastructure receive more seamless access to Travis CI builds for free. Currently, users building on public repositories are required to contact Travis CI support to request free open source credits. However, with the Zero-Credit Partner Queue Solution, this step is bypassed and open source builds are easier to run than ever – simply invoke one supported infrastructure using the “arch” script hook, or use multiple through a multiarch build. The following is a brief summary of sponsored infrastructure types covered under this solution:

* IBM Power (using ppc64le) and IBM Z (using s390x), which run using LXD containers offering faster spin-up times and the ability to dynamically assign more computing power (when available) to increase build speeds.

* Arm64 builds on AWS Graviton2 and Equinix Metal Arm-based cloud platforms, which offer developers two virtualization environments for Linux builds: LXD containers, as well as full VM environments, which offer HugePages and privileged filesystem access support with a fixed number of CPUs and memory. 

For more information on how to build for the Zero-Credit Partner Queue, refer to the [building on multiple CPU architectures guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-cpu-architectures/) on the Travis CI website. Developers simply need to modify their open-source project’s YAML file to use the appropriate environment without having to worry about credit consumption.

Travis CI prides itself on its contributions to the open source community, and we look forward to continuing to engage with all Travis CI users in an effort to bring greater clarity. For any questions on this topic or anything else, please contact support@travis-ci.com.
